Just a fun thought I had today: generate all the GUIDs!!!

<!--more-->

Many people have pondered the uniqueness of various ID structures we have for computing (GUIDs, UUIDs, etc).  In the end, any structure that must be represented by a finite number of bits has a finite number of combinations of those bits.

That said, for the .Net `Guid` class, [Mr. Dee](http://mrdee.blogspot.co.nz/2005/11/how-many-guid-combinations-are-there.html) has a nice/funny thread about this inherent limit.

> There are 122 random bits (128 - 2 for variant - 4 for version) so this calculates to 2<sup>122</sup> or 5,316,911,983,139,663,491,615,228,241,121,400,000 possible combinations.

Perhaps [a StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2977648/878701) can help to put this in perspective:

> And since there are about 7×10<sup>22</sup> stars in the universe, and just under 2<sup>128</sup> GUIDs, then there are approximately 4.86×10<sup>15</sup> — almost five quadrillion — GUIDs for every single star.

Knowing this, I've concluded that it's our responsibility as computer scientists to generate *every single GUID* at some point in our collective lifetimes.  To that end, I've started writing my unit tests so that they generate new GUIDs with each test.  The more, the better!  Whenever I need a random identifier, I use a GUID.  Whenever I need a random string, I use a GUID.

With your help, I believe that we can achieve this goal.
