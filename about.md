I have officially been a professional developer since late 2012. Iâ€™m currently working in Auckland, New Zealand.  I've worked with several companies here.  There's a lot of friendly software talent here in NZ, and I'm very happy to be here.

I started my software journey with GameStop, located in Grapevine, TX, where I built software for the point of sale (POS) running in each and every store globally.

Prior to software development, I was in the world of aerospace manufacturing. I found myself at a couple companies right when they were going through a major reorganization to become more efficient via the power of Lean Manufacturing. I learned a lot about waste during those years, and every day I endeavor to apply that knowledge to the software I write. I find it fascinating how much the two parallel each other.
