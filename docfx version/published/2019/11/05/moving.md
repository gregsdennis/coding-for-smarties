# Changing Spaces

So I think I'm done with WordPress.  I like being able to write with Markdown.  WordPress makes that difficult.

I suppose they're catering to less techy people, and that's fine.  But it doesn't suit me well.

So I'm going start this up again, and I'm going to do it with GitHub Pages.  I might write a post about the process, but don't hold your breath.

It's been this long since I previously posted.  A bit longer won't hurt.  I've already got a new one up on my feelings regardig C# 8.  It'll be my first post on the new site.

I'll put up a new short post here when I have the other site up.
